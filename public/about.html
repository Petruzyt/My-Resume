<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Since I was a kid, I loved to draw - and i have to say I was pretty good at  it (still I am). 
  Drawing for me was like getting into some different world where everything was just like I imagined.
  It felt like everything that was drawn seemed to come to life.

<p>High School came around, and suprised me with good mathematical skills. In class I was the best student.
  So it was easy for me to pick math on matura exam, along with English, biology and chemistry. 
  I know it's quite a lot but it wasn't hard for me.

<p>College became my next step. Studing at Warsaw University of Technology is one of my biggest achievement.
  Discovering my knack for math made me feel that i wanted to share my knowledge with others and helping them 
  to simple like doing some math. Because of that I started giving lessons as a math tutor. 
  My math enthusiast keeps me going till now.

  These days, I'm all about diving into the world of web coding. 
  From sketching cool stuff on paper to crafting interactive web experiences, I'm on a mission to blend creativity with logic.
